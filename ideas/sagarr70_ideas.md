# Hi My name Sagar Aggarwal


I want to share ideas about building a great App which could solve a very big problem of farmer sucides in india.
Usually the main reason behind the sucides of farmers is that the crop which they grow is either afffected by bad weather or the price at which they want to sell the crops are very low.
This problem could be solved if we try to make an effort of building an app which could help farmers directly sell their crops to the consumers.
